# ![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) React, Redux, Async, and Servers

## Objectives
* Students will make a request from their app to their server
* Students will use thunk middleware for async actions in action creators

---
# React "Ropes"
* When something goes wrong in your application you've got to
  "run the ropes" to figure exactly where the error occurs.

Consider everything that happens when you click a button:

* Verify things render correctly
* HTML renders the button
* The button is attached to a click (or submit) handler
* The handler may accept parameters (verify these!)
* The handler may process data (verify this!)
* The handler dispatches an action
* It runs through an action creator
* The action arrives at the reducer
* Verify it passes through the reducer without errors!

Use your knowledge of these lifecycles to debug your apps!

# Attaching Middleware (reminder)
```js
import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'

const todoApp = combineReducers(reducers)
const store = createStore(
  todoApp,
  applyMiddleware(logger, crashReporter)
)
```

---
# Example Logger (reminder)

```js
const logger = store => reducer => action => {
  console.log('dispatching', action)
  let result = reducer(action)
  console.log('new state', store.getState())
  return result
}


```
---
# Example Logger (reminder)

```js
const logger = store => next => action => {
  console.log('dispatching', action)
  let result = next(action)
  console.log('next state', store.getState())
  return result
}
```

---
# Example Crash Reporter (reminder)
```js
const crashReporter = store => next => action => {
  try {
    return next(action)
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Caught an exception!', err)
    throw err
  }
}
```

---
# Example Timeout (reminder)
* Schedules actions with { meta: { delay: N } } to be delayed by N milliseconds.
* Makes `dispatch` return a function to cancel the timeout in this case.

```js
const timeoutScheduler = store => next => action => {
  if (!action.meta || !action.meta.delay) {
    return next(action)
  }

  const timeoutId = setTimeout(
    () => next(action),
    action.meta.delay
  )

  return function cancel() {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId)
  }
}
```

---
# Example Thunk (reminder)
* The `thunk` middleware intercepts functions that are dispatched as actions and executes them.
* It allows anything that's not a function to pass through as it regularly would.
* `thunk` is great for running code like `fetch` that downloads data from the internet asynchronously,
  then, when it receives the data, has access to dispatch to dispatch an action to update and display
  results.

```js
const thunk = store => next => action =>
  typeof action === 'function'
    ? action(store.dispatch, store.getState)
    : next(action)
```

```js
import {showResults} from './actions/search-actions';

dispatch((dispatch, store) => {
  fetch('http://www.reddit.com/r/movies.json')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(json => {
    dispatch(showResults(json));
  });
})
```

# New Tools!! yarn and parcel (optional)

Web Development goes at a fast pace. People make new tools quickly. Here are
two new tools some people are finding useful. Decide for yourself!

```js
npm install -g yarn
npm install -g parcel
```

* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
  * replaces `npm`
  * "Fast, reliable, and secure dependency management."
  * why? _much_ faster than `npm`
* [parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
  * replaces `webpack`
  * "blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler"
  * why? _zero configuration_. truly. write your app, not webpack!

# Parcel Dependencies
* Parcel also came out with a new feature where it automatically
installs dependencies!
* Try starting with bare-bones project set up and see what it
  fills in!

```js
yarn add babel-core babel-preset-env babel-preset-react babel-preset-stage-0 react react-dom react-redux react-router-dom redux
```
