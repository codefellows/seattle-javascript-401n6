# Class 16 Basic Authorization

## Objective

* Students will learn about cryptographic hash and cypher algorithms
* Students will be able to model a User and safely store their sensitive data
* Students will be able to implement a Basic Authorization parser

---
# Hash Algorithms

* One-way street
* Takes data as input and returns a long number
* Impossible to reverse the output number into the original data
* The same data will always produce the same long number
* Used to verify the integrity of data

---
# Cypher Algorithms

* Two-way street
* Encrypts data, but provides a reversible way to decrypt it

Never seriously try to make you're own cypher algorithm. People have
spent years and years making and breaking cypher algorithms.

# ROT-13 Algorithm
A simple cypher algorithm.  Rotate each letter 13 spaces in the alphabet.  The
encode method is the same as the decode method.

* A becomes N
* B becomes O
* ...
* N becomes A
* O becomes B

# The Authorization Header

There's a specification that dictactes how users can supply usernames and passwords
to log in to system via HTTP. Users can use a special HTTP header `Authorization`.

It looks like this:

```http
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l
```

The string `QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l` represents an encoded form of a username
and password.

The specification says to take the username `Aladdin` and the password
`OpenSesame` and put them together with a colon, like `Aladdin:OpenSesame`
then it runs that string through Base64 encoding.

---
# Base-64 Encoding

Base64 encoding is a common encoding. It is easy to encode and decode information.
Encoding usernames and passwords with Base64 does not protect any secrets. It only
makes for a good standard for the specification.

* [Wikipedia Base64 Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)

JavaScript has two Base64 encode and decode methods built into the language:

```js
let username = 'Aladdin';
let password = 'OpenSesame';
let userInfo = username + ':' + password;

let encoded = btoa(userInfo);
let decoded = atob(encoded);
```

---
# Accessing the Authorization Header
* Use `req.get('Authorization')` to read the value of the
  `Authorization` header off the HTTP request.
* Use `Buffer.from(someString, 'base64').toString()` to convert
  a Base64-encoded string into it's original value.

```js
router.get('/signin', (req, res) => {
  let authHeader = req.get('Authorization')
  let payload = authHeader.split('Basic ')[1]
  let decoded = Buffer.from(payload, 'base64').toString()
  let [username, password] = decoded.split(':')
}
```

---
# bcrypt

* `bcrypt` is a useful NPM package.
* Use `.hash(password, numRounds)` to encrypt a password.
* Use `.compare(password, hash)` to see if a password matches a hash

```js
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');

const password = 'elephant'
const rounds = 10;
bcrypt.hash(password, rounds, (err, hash) => {
  bcrypt.compare(password, hash, (err, isValid) => {
    console.log('Password:', password);
    console.log('    Hash:', hash);
    console.log('  Match?:', isValid);
  });
});
```

---

# Saving Hashed User Passwords

* Never store plain-text passwords!
* Only store the hash of the password.

![Dont ever store plain-text passwords](dont-ever.gif)

---
# Saving Hashed User Passwords

```js
// modify the 'save' pre hook on a mongoose User schema
User.pre('save', function(next) {
  // hash the password the first time it's saved
  if (this.isNew) {
    bcrypt.hash(this.password, 10, (err, hash) => {
      this.password = hash
      this.passwordHash = hash
      next();
    });
  }
});
```

**Notice:** we must use an old-school ES5 function here to get the proper
context of this with `this.isNew` attached Trust me, a `() => {}` arrow function
won't work here.

---
# Checking Passwords
Attach a new method to the User Schema so we can easily check passwords later.

```js
User.checkPassword = function(attempt) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    bcrypt.compare(attempt, this.password, (err, valid) => {
      if (err) {
        reject(err)
      }
      resolve(valid)
    })
  })
}
```

---
# Protecting a Route

* Protect any route by tying all the pieces together.
* Access the `Authorization` header
* Decode the Base64-encoded string
* Access the username and passwaord
* Query your database to find a user with that username
* Use bcrypt to compare the password they just send with the stored
  hashed password
* Return and send `200` or `400` status codes as appropriate.

# Check for Understanding
## What's the difference between a hash and a cipher?

- A hash is irreversible.
- A hash is used to verify data-consistency.

* A cipher is reversible.
* A cipher can be encoded and decoded.
* It should be hard to reverse data encoded with a cipher.

# Check for Understanding
## What's the best cipher algorithm in the world?

- Whichever one you didn't write.
- There are multiple good implementations.
- Some have been proven non-useful over time
  - cyptographic researchers discovered fundamental flaws
  - governments put in backdoors
