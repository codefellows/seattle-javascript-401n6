# ![CF](http://i.imgur.com/7v5ASc8.png) 32 Redux: Combining Reducers

## Objectives
* Students will learn to use redux with react
* Students will learn to design redux reducer's for controlling application state
* Students will learn to design action creator functions for working with redux

---
# Recap: Store, Reducer, Actions
* All application state is kept in the **store**
* The store receives messages with **actions**
* The store uses a **reducer** to find out how it should manipulate it's
  state according to the `.type` of the action.

* Components use `mapStateToProps` to pick data out of the state in the store
  and attach it as if it were passed as props.
* Components use `mapDispatchToProps` to create props that are functions that
  can send messages with actions back to the store via `dispatch()`

---
# Recap: Reducer

* A **reducer** is a function that accepts a state and an action
  and returns a new state
* `(state, action) -> newState`
* Import constants from an actions file to see what types of actions
  are supported.

```js
import {ADD} from '../actions/math-actions';
const initialState = {data: 0};

export default function counterReducer(state, action) {
  if (state === undefined) {
    return initialState;
  }

  let newState = {};
  switch(action.type) {
    case ADD:
      return Object.assign(newState, state, {data: state.data + 1});
    default: return state;
  }
```

---
# Recap: Store
* Import `createStore` from `redux` and pass in a reducer. 
* Import the `<Provider>` component, give it the `store` as a prop
  and wrap your entire `<App>` with the `<Provider>`.

```js
import {createStore} from 'redux';
import {Provider} from 'react-redux'

import myReducer from '../reducers/my-reducer';
const store = createStore(myReducer);

render() {
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>
}
```

---
# Recap: Actions
* Actions carry messages to the `store`
* Actions are plain-old-javascript-objects ("POJOs") with a `.type` property,
* Actions may optionally have other properties with more data (like the
  contents of a new TODO item)
* Define action types as string contants.
* Include functions called **action creators** that bundle together action
  data in an object with the `.type` specified.

**counter-actions.js**
```js
export const DELETE_ALL = 'DELETE_ALL';
export const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO';

export function addTodo(text) {
  return {type: ADD_TODO, text: todo}
}

export function deleteAll() {
  return {type: DELETE_ALL}
}
```

---
# Combining Reducers
* As an application becomes more complex you will create multiple reducers.
* Redux supports automatically combining multiple reducers into one reducer
  with the `combineReducers` function.

**reducers/index.js**
```js
import {combineReducers} from 'redux';
import counterAppReducer from './counter-app';
import timestampReducer from './timestamp';

export default combineReducers({
  counter: counterAppReducer,
  timestamps: timestampReducer
})
```

---
# Accessing Combined Reducers
* Access the state associated with each reducer according to what property
name you associated it with in `combineReducers`.
* Here the component uses `mapStateToProps` and accesses the timestamps in the
  timestamps reducer with `state.timestamps.timestamps` 

**reducers/index.js**
```js
export default combineReducers({
  counter: counterAppReducer,
  timestamps: timestampReducer
})
```

**components/some-component.js**
```js
render() { 
	{this.props.timestamps.map(timestamp -> <div>{timestamp.toString}</div>)};
}

const mapStateToProps = state => {
  return {timestamps: state.timestamps.timestamps};
}
```

---
# (reference) Timestamp Reducer

```js
import {STAMP} from '../actions/timestamp-actions';

const initialState = {
  timestamps: []
};

export default function counterReducer(state, action) {
  if (state === undefined) {
    return initialState;
  }

  let newState = {};
  switch(action.type) {
    case STAMP:
      return Object.assign(newState, state, {
        timestamps: [...state.timestamps, new Date()]
      });
    default: return state;
  }
}
```

---
# Summary
* Complex applications require multiple reducers
* Multiple reducers allow us to cordon uncommon code to multiple files
* Having multiple reducers across multiple files makes it easier for us
  to reason about our applications, and makes collaborating with source
  control easier. (less merge conflicts!)

Practical multiple-reducer examples (if you are facebook):
* A reducer for creating a new post
* A reducer for flipping through photos in an album
* A reducer for loading stories while scrolling through a timeline
* A reducer for tagging friends in a photo
* A reducer for searching for friend's profiles
* A reducer for choosing your top eight friends
