## AWS S3	
Amazon Simple Storage Service (AWS S3) is simple but powerful cloud data
storage solution. It can hold assets of any size. File assets can be uploaded
to S3 Buckets. Buckets are essentially file systems that can hold files and
folders. In an S3 Bucket a filename is called a Key. Each asset in stored in
a Bucket has a URI and specific permissions. If the asset has public read
permissions anyone can retrieve the asset using a GET request.	
	
S3 is used for storing large data assets that databases can not handle. S3 is
commonly used to host images, videos, audio, 3D models, CSV files, application
files, binary executables, and much more.
