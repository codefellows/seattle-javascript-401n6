# Class 17 Bearer Authorization with JSON Web Tokens

## Objectives
* Students will be able to create a Bearer Authentication parser
* Students will learn to implement Access Controls in their HTTP server routes

---
# Venue Analogy
* Imagine you're attending a show.
* When you arrive to the show you tell the door person the performer has
  put your name on a list.
* The door person looks at their list, and finds your name
* The door person looks at your ID to prove your name
* The door person lets you in

Later on you step outside, and then try to reenter the venue. 

* The door person doesn't recognize you. (They never do)
* You tell them you're on the list.
* They check their list agian, find your name and let you in.

You leave and re-enter several more times. The door person keeps
forgetting you and they must keep checking their list. Everyone's
tired of checking the list.

Their must be a better way!

---
# A Better Venue
Another day you come back to the venue and find out a new manager has upgraded
their door policies. They have a new system in place which they've found to be
quite efficient.

* You arrive to a show where a perfomer has put you on a list.
* You tell the door person your name.
* The door person finds your name on their list.
* You show them your id to prove you're you.

Here's where things change!

* This time you get a bracelet!
* The door person says you can show them your bracelet and they'll know
  you've already been authorized to come in the venue.

You go in and out of the venue all night. Instead of giving your name
and checking their list you walk through the door much more quickly
because you simply have to show the door person the bracelet you're
wearing.

---
# Venue Analogy Explained
* Having your name on a list is like having your user information stored
  in a database.
* Providing your name and checking the list is like `Basic` authorization
  where you provide your username and password on every request.

What we'll see in today's lesson is that it's possible for the server to
give users a `Token` that they can use later to prove that they've already
been approved from the list.

`JSON Web Tokens` are passed through HTTP headers. The token contains information
about who a user is, what a user is allowed to do, and they contain a special
signature that proves the token came from the server.

---
# Bearer Authorization
Previously we looked at `Basic Authorization`. It sent a username and a password
to the server inserted as a header. The header looked like this:

```http
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l
```

* Bearer authorization still uses the `Authorization` header
* It replaces the word `Basic` with `Bearer`
* It sends a `<token>` which we'll see contains much more data
  than simply a user name and password

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

---
# JSON Web Token Structure
A JSON web token is a Base-64-encoded string. It contains three different
sections of data, all concatenated together with a `.` dot.

There are `Header`, `Payload`, and `Signature` sections.

All together they might look this like:

![JSON web token](./token.png)

---
# Analyzing Token Structure
Go to [jwt.io](http://jwt.io) to use their excellent tool for analyzing the
contents of a JSON Web Token.

![JWT.io tool](./jwt-tool.png)

---
# The Header

```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

The header is a small JSON object that contains information about how
the JSON Web Token was created.

This header says that the algorithm `alg` used to encrypt the JSON Web
Token is called `HS256`.

---
# The Payload

```json
{
  "exp": "Sunday, September 13, 2020 12:26:40 PM GMT",
  "username": "mayor@seattle.gov",
  "admin": true
}
```

The payload contains meta-data and information about the user.

This payload says three things:
* The entire token expires ("exp") at a certain time
* This token represents someone with the username
* The user with this token is an administrator

Strict formats of JSON Web Tokens define "claims" about users with all sorts
of formal definitions. In this course we will simply not treat the payload
so formally.

One example of a formal property in the payload would be the `"exp"` property
which represents when a JSON webtoken will expire.

---
# The Signature
* The signature helps verify the integrity of the data inside the header
and the payload.
* The signature prevents users from rewriting their tokens
* For example, If the signature weren't present someone could change the
  `admin` property from `true` to `false`

`HMACSHA256` here represents one of many possible encryption algorithms.

```js
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." +
  base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret)
```

---
# Code: How to Sign JWT Tokens

```js
require('dotenv').config();  // import dotenv package for process.env access
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');  // import the jwt package

let payload = {username: 'mayor', isAdmin: true};
let token = jwt.sign(payload, process.env.SECRET);
```

---
# Code: How to Verify JWT Tokens

Create a piece of middleware you can use to verify the JSON Web Token
and attach user information to the `req` request object so it's available in
other routes.

**lib/bearer-auth-middleware.js**
```js
function(req, res, next) {
  // read the user information from the "Authorization" header.
  var authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
  var token = authHeader.split('Bearer ')[1];

  jwt.verify(token, process.env.SECRET, (err, decoded) => {
    User.findOne({ username: decoded.username })
    .then(user => {
      req.user = user;

      // go to the next piece of middleware
      next();
    });
  });
}
```

---
# The .env File
* We're beginning to have small pieces of configuration that exist in our code.
* It's nice to gather these all together and put them in once place.
* We can configure our servers to read configurations from a special `.env`
  file.
* `.env` files can contain confidential information so it's a good idea to
  add the `.env` to your `.gitignore`

We'll see ourselves add more sensitive information to `.env` files in the
future when we begin deploying our servers publically.

(**NOTE:** properties on `process.env` can also be defined inside your bash
environment, but we'll just be using the `.env` file.)

Run this if you want to stare into the sun and see all the properties attached
to `.env`:

```js
console.log(process.env)
```

---
# .env Configuration and Access

**.env**
```env
PORT=3000
SECRET=moon
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/17-bearer-auth
```

**.gitignore**
```gitignore
node_modules
.env
```

Now you can access any of these properties by requiring and configuring the
`dotenv` package and accessing these properties off a special `process.env`
variable.

```js
require('dotenv').config();  // import dotenv package for process.env access

console.log('PORT:', process.env.PORT);
console.log('SECRET:', process.env.SECRET);
console.log('MONGODB_URI:', process.env.MONGODB_URI);
```

---
# Access Control
Now that we have users and secure authentication mechanisms on our servers
we want to use them.

Think of a service like Twitter.

* People post tweets.
* People can read other people's tweets.
* People can delete their own tweets.
* People aren't allowed to delete other people's tweets.

`Access Control` defines what information users are allowed to access
and manipulate.

We can use JSON Web Tokens to define what sort of data users are allowed
to access and manipulate.

When someone requests to get all of a certain resource we can return only
resources that they've created themselves, or are specifically allowed to
access.

# Check for Understanding
## What's the name of the header used for both `Basic` and `Bearer` authorization?

---
# Check for Understanding
## What's the name of the header used for both `Basic` and `Bearer` authorization?

`Authorization`. The format for each specification looks like this:

```http
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l
```

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## What is the role of the Signature in a token?

## What is the role of the Signature in a token?
The signature prevents users from tampering with the rest of the data in
the JSON Web Token.
