  * Are you using an external API? Make sure you can get what you need!

## Second Milestone Objectives
* Write the auth layer of your application
* Build MongoDB models
* Strive for 90% test code coverage
* Minimum viable product

## Third Milestone Objectives
* Extend MVP with more models, more routes more features
* Continue striving for 90% code coverage

## Fourth Milestone Objectives
* Finsh any loose ends
* Write documentation for all features of your application
* Pratice your presentation

# Group agreement
Now that you've had a chance to talk some as a group, step away from the
project pitch to develop a group agreement. This is a document that your group
creates collaboratively; it details your expectations of how you will work with
each other. It is a "living document" - that is, it can be changed as you go
along to meet your group's needs as they emerge. Again, develop this
collaboratively and write it down together on a whiteboard. Keep refining it
until everyone in the group agrees with it.

At the minimum, it should cover:

* **Scheduling:** What's the expected time commitment for the project?
* **Communication plan:** How will your group communicate with each other? What
  is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that
  contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? Do you have
  a plan for managing psychological safety, as we learned about in the article
  on Google and teams from Class 14?
* **Conflict plan:** What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What
  will your process be to resolve it?
* **Work plan:** How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are
  complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how
  you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the JavaScript, CSS,
  and HTML portions, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.
* **Git process:** What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who
  merges PRs?  Any thing else you feel is important: expectations around work
  times, standup times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.
