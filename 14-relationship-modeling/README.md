===

## Learning Objectives
* Students will learn about relationship modeling
* Students will be able to create "one to one", "one to many", and "many to
  many" model relationships using a MongoDB ODM

## Resources
* Read [mongoose populate docs](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html)
* Skim [mongoose api docs](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html)

## Model Relationships
When the modeling real world as data you will quickly discover that data has
relationships to other data. In fact in the real world it is rare, if not
impossible, for something to exist that has no relationships to other things.
On the other hand in theoretical world we can describe a thing with out
describing its relationships to other things. Software engineers have
discovered useful ways to describe the relationships (or lack of) between data
that can easily be mapped to a database.

#### One
A Model that stands on its own. A web app example includes a simple Note that
has no relationship with any other model, It contains all the data it needs.

```
Note
  id: 1
  content 'get milk and cookies.'
```

#### One to One
When a Model Foo that is related to a single Model Bar. Some web app examples
include every user having a single profile, every profile having a single
profile photo, every client is limited to a single contact email.

```
User
  id: 888
  username: slugbyte
  profileID: 123

Profile
  id: 123
  bio: 'i love javascript'
  url: 'www.codefellows.com'
  userID: 888
```

#### One to Many
A Model Foo that is related to many Bar Models. Some web app examples include
every user having may posts but posts have a singe user, every photo having
many comments but each comment is to a single photo, every post having many
likes but each like is to a single post.

```
Photo
  id: 5678
  url: 'www.example.com/image/sunset.jpg'
  comments: [ 44 65 78 ]

Comment
  id: 44
  content: 'SO MUCH BEAUTY! <3'

Comment
  id: 65
  content: 'awesome photo'

Comment
  id: 78
  content: 'LUL, look at the clouds'
```


#### Many to Many
Many Foo models that can each have relationships to many Bar Models. A web app
examples includes every user having a relation ship with many friends and each
of those users have relationships with a many different friends.

Some databases (including MongoDB) do not natively support models having many
to many relationships, but many to many can still be created through the use of
a second model.

###### Using One Model
```
User
  id: 1234
  username: 'teapot'
  friends: [ 1001 3333 4321 ]

User
  id: 1001
  username: 'peach'
  friends: [ 1234 5000 ]
```

###### Using A Second Model
```
User
  id: 1234
  username: 'teapot'
  friendsID: 33

User
  id: 1001
  username: 'peach'
  freindsID: 77

Friends
  id: 33
  users: [ 1001 3333 4321]

Friends
  id: 77
  users: [ 1234 5000 ]
```
