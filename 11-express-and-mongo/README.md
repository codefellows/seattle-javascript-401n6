===

## Learning Objectives
* Students will learn about MongoDB and Express
* Students will be able to create RESTful HTTP servers with Express
* Students will be able to persist data using MongoDB

## Resources
* Skim [express api docs](http://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html)
* Read [express routing](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)
* Read [MongoDB Driver QuickStart](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.2/quick-start/quick-start/)
* Skim [MongoDB Driver Collection API Docs](http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/2.2/api/Collection.html)

## Express
Express is a lightweight framework for building web servers. Express
extends the NodeJS `http` module with a minimal feature set that enables
developers to quickly build powerful web applications. Express features
include routing with url params, error handling, a static server, cookie and
link helpers, convenience methods for sending json and jsonp, location and
redirect management, request parsing, server side rendering, and a framework
for creating middleware to extend express.

## MongoDB
MongoDB is a free and open-source document oriented database. This is referred
to as a NoSQL database management system. It allows developers to create
schemas and store and query JSON like documents. MongoDB has a powerful query
system that supports field queries, range queries, and regular expression
searches. Documents can be indexed with primary and secondary keys. MongoDB
databases can scale horizontally using a technique called sharding, that
enables many MongoDB databases to act as one through the use of a load
balancer. MongoDB has an aggregation framework that enables developers to
process data and return computed results. MongoDB has grown in popularity among
teams that strive for agile and rapid development of their products. It is
a great database for storing key value pairs.

Although MongoDB has many great features for building modern web applications, it
is not good at solving the following problems:

- MongoDB does not support joins, and therefore doesn't model relational data well
- It is not good for storing binary data (like images)
- It is not small enough to run as an embedded DB (like on a phone)
- It is also not good at doing large MapReduce jobs (huge aggregations)

If your application depends on doing many of these operations, you may
want to consider using other database technologies.

MongoDB, like many databases, is built on the client-server model. A MongoDB
Server called a Mongo
[Daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) is run as
a background task on a host. A Client such as a MongoDB Shell or MongoDB Driver
can connect to the MongoDB Dameon to run queries. MongoDB Drivers are libraries
that enable developers to make queries from a programming language.
