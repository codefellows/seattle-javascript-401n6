## Learning Objectives
* Students will learn to use ES6 Promises to manage asynchronous Javascript
* Students will learn to build RESTful HTTP servers

## Resources
* Read [JavaScript Promises: an Introduction](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises)
* Watch [Fun Fun Functions: Promises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d7s3spWAzo)

## URI vs URL
A URI is a string of characters used to identify a resource. A URI could be an
book ISBN, a street address, a web address, or anything else. URLs are URIs
that identify resources on the world wide web. A URL must contain everything it
needs to retrieve a resource. `/dashboard` is a URI where
`https://www.example.com/dashboard` is a URL.

#### Generic URI Anatomy
```
   scheme          auth             host      port      path             query         fragment
  ┌────┴────┐┌──────┴─────────┐┌─────┴───────┐┌─┴─┐┌─────┴──────┐┌─────────┴──────────┐┌──┴───┐
  protocol://username:password@api.example.com:3000/path/resource?key=value&key2=value2#fragid1
```

## [REST](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/REST)
The HTTP specification describes an interface for making requests to an HTTP
server, but does not provide semantic guidelines on how that interface should
be used. There are many semantic schemas for how HTTP servers should be
designed, but Representational State Transfer (REST) is the most common. REST
places constraints on how servers can manage requests in order to improve
scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and
reliability. RESTful services must subscribe to a client-server architecture
in-order to separate the user interface concerns from data storage concerns.
RESTful services must be stateless, which prevents the server from managing session
state and forces all requests to contain all the information necessary to
service the request. RESTful services must support caching. RESTful services
should support a layered system, which means clients should not care if the
server is the end server or an intermediary server (load balancer or cache).
RESTful services should enforce a uniform interface that follows four specific
constraints.

#### Four User Interface Constraints
| Constraint | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Resource identification in requests  | The resource (model) is identified using the URI |
| Resource manipulation through representations | The representation of a resource (JSON) should contain enough information for a client to modify or delete a resource |
| Self-descriptive messages | Each request should describe how it should be processed (The client should set headers like `Content-Type: application/json` and query strings like `page=3`) |
| Hypermedia as the engine of application state | The client should be able to dynamically discover all the available actions and resources it needs using an OPTIONS request |

#### RESTful HTTP Methods
| METHOD | URI | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | /api/notes | Create a note resource |
| GET | /api/notes or /api/notes/:id  | Read a note resources or a note resource |
| Put/Patch | /api/notes/:id | Update a note resource |
| Delete |  /api/notes/:id | Delete a note resource |
| HEAD | /api/notes/:id | Read metadata about note a resource |
| OPTIONS |  /api/notes | Discover methods available for a note resources |

## Server Side Routers
Server side routers provide an interface to define how a server should respond to
a given endpoint. An endpoint is defined as an HTTP method in combination with
a URI path. Routers help simplify complexity and increase readability.

## Promises
Promises are objects that represent an asynchronous event that will either
succeed or fail. They are an amazing tool for improving readability and data
flow control between synchronous and asynchronous code.

#### Promise States
* **pending** - initial state - not fulfilled or rejected
* **fulfilled** - the operation completed successfully
* **rejected** - the operation failed
* **settled** - has fulfilled or rejected

#### Promise Static methods
* `Promise.all(array)` - returns a `Promise` object that fulfills when all of
  the promises in an array have succeded or one has failed
* `Promise.race(array)` - returns a `Promise` object that fulfills when one of
  the promises in an array has succeded or failed
* `Promise.reject(value)` - returns a `Promise` object that is rejected with a given value
* `Promise.resolve(value)` - returns a `Promise` object that is resolved with a given value

#### Promise Instance Methods
* `catch((err) => {})` - registers a callback for handling a failure
* `then((data) => {})` - registers a callback for handling a success
