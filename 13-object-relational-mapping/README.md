* Read [Mongoose: Middleware](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/middleware.html)

## ORMs and ODMs
Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting
relational database models to a programming language data-type using Object
Oriented Programing. ORM libraries enable developers to use their programming
language to control a database instead of using the database's native query
language. They can help developers write cleaner and safer code, by abstracting
away the complexities of database languages. Object Document Mapping (ODM)
libraries function similar to ORM libraries but work with NoSQL databases that
use document database models.
