## Objectives
* Students will learn to about composition vs inheritance
* Students will learn to compose react components using props

# Composition and Inheritance
In programming there's two ways to build new classes out of already-created:
`inheritance` and `composition`. These concepts apply to every language that
support classes and `inheritance`.

Inheritance is a built-in language feature that allows one class to `extend`
(or "inherit") from another class. Composition does this manually by saving
a reference of one class as a property in the second class.

---
# Inheritance
Inheritance is great. It allows programms to create hierarchies between classes
like `Animal` then create classes like `Mammal`, `Bird`, `Fish` and so on.

It turns out that inheritance is great until it isn't. Writing programs with
strict inheritance often ends up colliding against reality. In theory inheritance
is great. In reality things get messy!

Designing programs solely with inheritance relationships often leads to
hard-to-express relationships between classes, and classes being shoe-horned
into baffling inheritance schemes just to satisfy inheritance requirements.

**Inheritance**
```js
class Person {}
class Seattleite extends Person {}
```

---
# Composition
`Composition` builds classes out of other classes by creating an instance of
one class inside another class instead of directly inheriting from it. Avoiding
string inheritance relationships allows the program to escape rigid heirarchy
structures and allows us to `compose` new classes out of just the parts of other
classes that we need.

**Composition**
```js
class Person {}
class Seattleite {
  constructor() {
    this.person = new Person();
  }
}
```

---
# Favor Composition over Inheritance
[Favor composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance)
is a programming principle that advocates to composes classes via `composition`
rather than through `inheritance`.

**Inheritance**
```js
class Person {}
class Seattleite extends Person {}
```

**Composition**
```js
class Person {}
class Seattleite {
  constructor() {
    this.person = new Person();
  }
}
```

# Inheritance in React

Here's what Facebook has to say about inheritance in React:

>At Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we haven’t found
>any use cases where we would recommend creating component inheritance
>hierarchies.
>
>Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a
>component’s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way. Remember that
>components may accept arbitrary props, including primitive values, React
>elements, or functions.
>
>If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, we suggest
>extracting it into a separate JavaScript module. The components may import it
>and use that function, object, or a class, without extending it.

# props.children
React has a special property on components `props.children`. This property
allows a components to be passed into another component and be rendered inside.
(This is how everything inside `<Router>` works!)

Here the `<h1>` and `<p>` inside `<FancyBorder>` are accessible through
the `props.childen` prop.

```jsx
function FancyBorder(props) {
  return (
    <div className={'FancyBorder FancyBorder-' + props.color}>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```jsx
function WelcomeDialog() {
  return (
    <FancyBorder color="blue">
      <h1 className="Dialog-title">Welcome</h1>
      <p className="Dialog-message">Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!</p>
    </FancyBorder>
  );
}
```

---
# Custom "holes" in Components
`props.children` is restricted to rendering everything passed into the
component all at once. If you want more fine-grain control over things passed
into the component you can pass them through props with specific names, just
like any other prop.


```js
function SplitPane(props) {
  return (
    <div className="SplitPane">
      <div className="SplitPane-left">
        {props.left}
      </div>
      <div className="SplitPane-right">
        {props.right}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <SplitPane left={<Contacts/>} right={<Chat/>} />
  );
}
```

# React Reacting to Double Clicks (and other events)
React has a long list of events you can attach to components and react to.

Refer to [the docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html)
to see all the events available and properties attached to event objects.

```md
onClick onContextMenu onDoubleClick onDrag onDragEnd onDragEnter onDragExit
onDragLeave onDragOver onDragStart onDrop onMouseDown onMouseEnter onMouseLeave
onMouseMove onMouseOut onMouseOver onMouseUp
```

```md
boolean altKey
boolean ctrlKey
boolean metaKey
DOMEventTarget relatedTarget
number screenX
number screenY
boolean shiftKey
... and many many more
```
