# Reverse an Integer
Write a function called `reverse` that accepts an integer as a parameter and
uses mathematical operations to return an integer with all the digits reversed.

You are forbidden from using Strings and Arrays. Solve this problem using only
mathematical operations like `+-*/` and `%` modulus. You may also `Math.floor`
to deal with rounding.

Given:

```
98274
```

Return:

```
47289
```

## Stretch Goal
Modify the function so it preserves the sign of the number. If the number
comes in negative then the digits should be reversed and a negative number
should be returned.
